generate workflow of updated SEWAGE script

obligatory inputs for main script:
    1. multifasta file, *fasta or file with pathways/to/fasta files
    2. schema for primers (preloaded into the github and are manually created by my)
    3. proportion of variants
        i. one of three choices for equal, random, and dVOC
    4. directory name for storeing final fastq files
        i. name can include pathway if desired

# work flow
1. load genome fasta file. DONE?
    i.fasta files can be a multifasta file or a list of pathways to those file
        ia. * write into script to check if file is a pathway list or muliti fasta file
2. create amplicons
    i. this should already be written but needs to be updated for the simpler version of SEWAGE
    ii. generate amplicon data is:
        ii.a. choose a scheme of primers
        ii.b check those primers in teh genomes
        ii.c if at least one primer is not found, the amplicon is not generate
        ii.d output is a fasta file and a log file for each genome
            ii.d.1 log file is a TSV with primers name, scheme name, fasta defline, start, end, sequecne length 
        ii.e all files are saved into a directory with extection .fasta or .log
3. enrichment process
    i. this step creates fastq files (paired end or long read) with the proporitons determined earlier 
    ii. once the amplicons are created, proporitonal data is applied to the amplicons
    iii. proporitonal data is determinedby one of three ways:
